## **Introduction**

This is an analysis of rides data as recorded by the safeboda app everytime a ride is ordered by a client, successful or unsuccessfully executed. Everyday a sigificant percentage of clients cancel their trip requests and we are trying to finf out why this is happening, how often it does happen and know potential actions to curb this as well as decrease these occurences. With a dataset that contains **fictional data** from SafeBoda, including trip dates, location, rider ID, arrival time, distance from client upon order, status of ride and other details. The goal is to carry out an analysis that will provide insight into the trends.
