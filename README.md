# SafeBoda rides cancellations analysis

## **Introduction**

This is an analysis of rides data as recorded by the safeboda app everytime a ride is ordered by a client, successful or unsuccessfully executed. Everyday a sigificant percentage of clients cancel their trip requests and we are trying to finf out why this is happening, how often it does happen and know potential actions to curb this as well as decrease these occurences. With a dataset that contains **fictional data** from SafeBoda, including trip dates, location, rider ID, arrival time, distance from client upon order, status of ride and other details. The goal is to carry out an analysis that will provide insight into the trends.

#### About the Data

The dataset is an excel file that contains two tables i.e. data dictionary and trip data with 163852 raws and 14 columns. We aswell have null entries and outliers that we shall need to get rid of.

#### Business Question

Task 1:

    1) What percentage of ride requests are cancelled?
    2) Sometimes after passengers have cancelled a ride, they immediately order another one. How could you try to calculate how often this happens? How often does that happen in this dataset? What fraction of customer journeys are cancelled and not re-ordered?
    3) Based on the current cancellation data, what are the most common reasons for passenger cancellations? Some ways to think about this might include - which days of the week have the highest cancelation rates? Which times of day? How long do passengers wait before they cancel a trip? What is the distance between the customer and driver?
          
Task 2:
    
    1) What further pieces of analysis might we want to run to understand more about passenger cancellation?
          
          ○ What data would you need?
         
          ○ How would this help you inform your analysis?
